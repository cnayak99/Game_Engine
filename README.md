These are the instructions including the startup process for our base game engine application and the controls for the controllable rectangle in it.
We will begin by explaining the controls because they will be important for Step 6 of the base game engine application startup.


**Controls**

C = Changes the method by which the window can be resized.

Up Arrow Key = Propels the controllable rectangle upwards, similar to a jump.
Can be pressed endlessly, resulting in the rectangle continuing to move upwards in a fashion similar to jumping.

Left Arrow Key = Moves the controllable rectangle left at a constant speed.

Right Arrow Key = Moves the controllable rectangle right at a constant speed.


**Startup Process**

Step 1.) Download the .zip file including the resources for the game engine.

Step 2.) Unzip the .zip file in a location that would be easy to access through VSCode.

Step 3.) Access the folder containing the game engine resources through VSCode.

Step 4.) In a VSCode terminal, change directories to the folder containing the game engine resources.

Step 5.) Enter the command "make" in the terminal.
The game engine should compile with no errors or warnings.

Step 6.) Enter the command "./game_engine_app" in the terminal.
This should start up the base game engine application, but be careful!
*If you do not move the controllable rectangle to a non-controllable rectangle soon after you open the game, then the controllable rectangle will accelerate with increasing speed downward off the screen.*


Thank you very much for viewing our game engine!
